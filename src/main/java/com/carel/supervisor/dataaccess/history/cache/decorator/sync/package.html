    Wrapper performs cache level synchronization.
    This is used internally by the cache policy factories.

    For many of the wrapper cache factories this locking policy is too general,
    however for a memory cache I think this is a good approach.

    Memory cache operations are very quick, and the cost of performing a cache-global lock
    is much less significant that the cost of getting a false negative response from a get.
