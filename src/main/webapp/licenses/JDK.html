Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of this<br/>Agreement,   including,  but  not  limited  to  the  Java   Technology<br/>Restrictions  of the  Supplemental  License Terms, Oracle grants you a<br/>non-exclusive,  non-transferable, limited license without license fees<br/>to reproduce and use internally  Software  complete and unmodified for<br/>the  sole  purpose  of  running  Programs.  Additional   licenses  for<br/>developers  and/or publishers are granted in the Supplemental  License<br/>Terms.<br/><br/>3.  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is confidential and copyrighted.  Title to<br/>Software and all associated  intellectual  property rights is retained<br/>by Oracle and/or its licensors.  Unless  enforcement  is prohibited by<br/>applicable  law, you may not modify,  decompile,  or reverse  engineer<br/>Software.  You acknowledge  that Licensed  Software is not designed or<br/>intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance<br/>of any nuclear facility.  Oracle Corporation  disclaims any express or<br/>implied  warranty  of  fitness  for such  uses.  No  right,  title  or<br/>interest in or to any  trademark,  service mark, logo or trade name of<br/>Oracle or its  licensors is granted under this  Agreement.  Additional<br/>restrictions for developers and/or  publishers  licenses are set forth<br/>in the Supplemental License Terms.<br/><br/>4.  LIMITED  WARRANTY.  Oracle  warrants  to you that for a period  of<br/>ninety (90) days from the date of  purchase, as evidenced by a copy of<br/>the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be<br/>free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except<br/>for the  foregoing,  Software  is  provided  "AS IS".  Your  exclusive<br/>remedy and Oracle's entire  liability under this limited warranty will<br/>be at Oracle's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid<br/>for Software.  Any implied  warranties  on the Software are limited to<br/>90 days.  Some  states do not  allow  limitations  on  duration  of an<br/>implied  warranty,  so the  above may not apply to you.  This  limited<br/>warranty gives you specific  legal rights.  You may have others, which<br/>vary from state to state.<br/><br/>5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS  SPECIFIED IN THIS  AGREEMENT, ALL<br/>EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED  CONDITIONS,   REPRESENTATIONS   AND  WARRANTIES,<br/>INCLUDING  ANY  IMPLIED  WARRANTY OF  MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS  FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR  NON-INFRINGEMENT  ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE<br/>EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.<br/><br/>6.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT  PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN<br/>NO EVENT WILL ORACLE OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST  REVENUE,<br/>PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br/>PUNITIVE   DAMAGES,  HOWEVER  CAUSED   REGARDLESS  OF  THE  THEORY  OF<br/>LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE<br/>SOFTWARE,  EVEN IF ORACLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>DAMAGES.  In no event  will  Oracle's  liability  to you,  whether  in<br/>contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount<br/>paid  by  you  for  Software  under  this   Agreement.  The  foregoing<br/>limitations  will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its<br/>essential   purpose.  Some  states  do  not  allow  the  exclusion  of<br/>incidental  or  consequential  damages, so some of the terms above may<br/>not be applicable to you.<br/><br/>7.  TERMINATION.  This Agreement is effective  until  terminated.  You<br/>may terminate  this  Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of<br/>Software.  This  Agreement will terminate  immediately  without notice<br/>from  Oracle  if you  fail  to  comply  with  any  provision  of  this<br/>Agreement.
